# OpenGround

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spcfa/OpenGround_a7105.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spcfa/OpenGround_a7105)

a FlySky AFHDS/AFHDS2A/Hubsan compatible opensource firmware for the flysky fs-i6s and the turnigy evolution.

Based on the excellent work by Fishpepper (http://www.fishpepper.de) to create the firmware for a cheap & take-everywhere radio for FrSky D8 protocol
